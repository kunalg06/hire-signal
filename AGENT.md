## What This Project Is

**AI Hire-Readiness Evaluation Platform** — employers post coding challenges, candidates complete them in isolated Docker containers with browser-based VS Code + Claude API access. The platform evaluates candidates across **8 AI-collaboration dimensions** and produces a hire recommendation (strong_hire / hire / select / pass) with a side-by-side candidate comparison view.

This is NOT an educational platform. It is a **hiring tool** for employers to evaluate AI-assisted coding competency.

---

## Key Product Decisions

- **8-Dimension scoring engine** (ArcEval/Vizuara framework):
  1. Problem Decomposition (15%)
  2. First-Principles Thinking (15%)
  3. Creative Problem Solving (10%)
  4. Iteration Quality (15%)
  5. Debugging with AI (15%)
  6. Architecture Decisions (10%)
  7. Communication Clarity (10%)
  8. Token Efficiency (10%)

- **Hire recommendations**: `strong_hire >= 85`, `hire >= 70`, `select >= 55`, `pass < 55`
  - Thresholds enforced in Python — never trust Claude's threshold determination alone

- **Human override policy**: AI scores inform, never decide. Employers can flag/override any score. Every override logged as calibration data. Visibility floor — score affects rank, never hides candidates.

- **Guarded vs Unguarded mode**: Unguarded = Claude can give full solutions. Guarded = Claude restricted to guidance only.

- **Challenge types**: `bug_fix | feature_extension | refactoring | optimization`
- **Skill areas**: `api_integration | rate_limiting | data_pipeline | llm_usage | server_monitoring | game_logic`

## Current Implementation State (~90% complete)

### ✅ Done — Epics 1–6 + Phase 1 integration fixes

#### Epic 1 — Bug Fixes (done 2026-06-30)
- Story 1.1 — efficiency score bug fixed (`submissions.py`)
- Story 1.2 — `container_id` passed into evaluation pipeline
- Story 1.3 — score bounds clamp: `min(100.0, max(0.0, ...))`

#### Phase 1 Integration Fixes (done 2026-07-02)
- LLM: Anthropic SDK → OpenRouter via `app/services/llm_service.py`
- CORS: `flask-cors` + relative `/api` URLs
- Docker SDK → subprocess CLI (`docker_service.py` rewritten)
- Workspace injection: `inject_workspace_files()` in `links.py`
- iframe: port range 7100–7900, removed sandbox, added warmup polling

#### Epic 3 — Market-Aligned Challenge System (done 2026-07-01)
- `challenges` table (12 cols), catalog CRUD endpoints
- `POST /api/generate-challenge` with type/skill/mode enums + validation
- Market-aligned generation prompt in `evaluation_service.py`
- Auto-persist generated challenges as unpublished

#### Epic 2 — 8-Dimension Scoring Engine (done 2026-07-01)
- `dimension_scores` + `hire_evaluations` tables
- `extract_container_files()` — full workspace snapshot (50KB cap, `{}` fallback)
- `score_8_dimensions()` — single Claude call, all 8 keys guaranteed
- Python-enforced thresholds (never trust Claude's)
- Per-dimension rows persisted; `GET /api/submission/<id>` returns full 8-dim response

#### Epic 5 — Employer Dashboard UI Overhaul (done 2026-07-02)
- Story 5.3 (Side-by-Side Comparison View) — overlaid radar + butterfly chart + rationale panels in Tab 5; code review complete, 4 issues fixed

#### Epic 6 — Student Experience & Preview as Student (done 2026-07-03)
- Story 6.1 — structured challenge display: `instructions.md` injected with Scenario / Your Task / Evaluation Criteria three-panel format
- Story 6.2 — verification nudge before submission; wording trimmed to exact spec after code review
- Story 6.3 — real polling: `startPolling()` in `student.py` hits `GET /api/submission/<id>` every 3s until `evaluated_at` set, 60s timeout; composite_score falsy-fallback fixed (0-score edge case)
- Story 6.4 — `GET /student/preview/<challenge_id>` preview route (no Docker); review fixed hire_data/hire_evaluation key mismatch, unescaped rec label, NaN guard, missing-submissionId guard. AC3 reworded: challenge-template preview, not assignment-fidelity
- Story 6.5 — guarded mode: `inject_workspace_files()` writes `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` for guarded challenges; `links.py` resolves `ai_assistance_mode` via `challenge_id`. Smoke-tested end-to-end through real containers. Guarded mode is honor-system-only (accepted v1 scope). chmod-skip-on-CLAUDE.md-failure bug fixed

#### Epic 4 — Candidate Comparison & Hiring Workflow (done 2026-07-02)

**Story 4.1 — Schema: comparison_sessions**
- `comparison_sessions` table in `database.py` `init_db()`
- DB methods: `create_comparison_session`, `get_comparison_session`, `list_comparison_sessions`

**Story 4.2 — Candidate comparison endpoint**
- `GET /api/challenges/<challenge_id>/candidates` — returns ALL candidates ranked by `composite_score` (default) or any of 8 dimension keys
- `sort_by` / `order` query params; 400 on invalid; 404 if challenge not found
- Each candidate has: `rank`, `is_evaluated`, `dimensions` dict, `composite_score`, `hire_recommendation`
- `dimension_averages` always returned (empty `{}` when no evaluated candidates)
- `assignments.challenge_id` column added via migration; `POST /api/assignments` accepts optional `challenge_id`

**Story 4.3 — Human override + flag**
- `POST /api/submissions/<id>/flag` — stores `is_flagged`, `flag_reason`, `flag_by`, `flagged_at`; `reason` required (400 if missing)
- `POST /api/submissions/<id>/override` — writes `is_overridden`, `override_recommendation`, `override_rationale` to `hire_evaluations`; original AI `composite_score` and `recommendation` NEVER touched
- Both return 404 (not found) / 409 (no evaluation exists to override)
- `GET /api/submission/<id>` now includes flag fields (indices 10–13)

**Story 4.4 — Override logging as calibration dataset**
- `score_overrides` table — append-only event log; every successful override inserts a row
- `GET /api/analytics/overrides` — returns `total_overrides`, `overrides_by_direction`, `recent_overrides` (last 20), `pattern_summary` (directions ≥20% share when total ≥10)
- `app/routes/analytics.py` — new blueprint registered in `app/__init__.py`

**Story 4.5 — Visibility floor enforcement**
- Un-evaluated candidates always sort LAST regardless of `order` direction (math.inf/-math.inf sentinel)
- `is_evaluated` boolean on each candidate (`row[7] is not None` from `he.evaluated_at`)

**Code review patches applied (2026-07-02):**
- `database.py` — migration `except Exception` → `except sqlite3.OperationalError` (both ALTER TABLE blocks)
- `submissions.py` — link_id fallback query now selects all 14 columns (was 9; flag fields were invisible)
- `challenges.py` — `dim_averages` now filters by `c['is_evaluated']` (not dict truthiness) and skips None scores
- `submissions.py` — flag/override routes check `rowcount > 0`; return 500 on silent DB failure

**Frontend sync fixes (applied alongside Story 4.4):**
- `saveAsAssignment()` — sends `challenge_id: currentChallengeId || null`
- `useCatalogChallenge()` — sends `challenge_id: id`
- Removed duplicate `viewInResults()` definition
- Flag and Override buttons added to Results detail panel (wired to `/flag` and `/override` endpoints)

## Next Session — Start Here

**Workflow state:** Epics 1–6 are all `done`. Epic 7 (Test Coverage) `in-progress`: Stories 7.1–7.3 done (dev + code review 2026-07-03; `tests/test_score_8_dimensions.py`, `tests/test_extract_container_files.py`, `tests/test_hire_recommendation_thresholds.py` — 38 tests total, root `conftest.py` bootstraps the test infra). Stories 7.4–7.5 remain (7.4 is the first integration test, not unit test — heavier setup expected).

**Next action:** Run `/bmad-create-story` to create the next story file.
- First backlog story in sprint order: **Story 7.4** (`7-4-integration-test-get-api-challenges-id-candidates`)

**Then:** Run `/bmad-dev-story` to implement it.

**Note:** Story 7.3 work (tests, story artifact, deferred-work entries) is **uncommitted** as of 2026-07-03 (Stories 7.1 and 7.2 were already committed as `09ca7e4` and `80696b9`). Notable deferred production findings so far: fence-stripping in `score_8_dimensions` only handles the exact ```json prefix (7.1); `extract_container_files` ignores its `workspace` parameter and its 50KB cap counts raw bytes but stores decoded text (7.2); `hire_recommendation` branches on the pre-round composite while `composite_score` stores the post-round value, so the two can visibly disagree near a boundary (7.3) — see deferred-work.md.

## Architecture Constraints — Read Before Writing Any Code

- **SQLite only** — no Postgres, no Redis. Raw SQL, no ORM. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is the migration strategy; `ALTER TABLE` via `try/except sqlite3.OperationalError` (not bare `except Exception`).
- **LLM via OpenRouter** — `LLMService` in `app/services/llm_service.py`; model via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` env var. Do NOT use `anthropic` SDK directly.
- **Docker via subprocess CLI** — `docker` Python SDK incompatible with requests≥2.32 on Python 3.14. All Docker ops go through `DockerService` in `docker_service.py`.
- **Container port range: 7100–7900** — ports below 7000 (esp. 6000–6007) are Chrome-blocked.
- **No non-ASCII in `print()` on Windows** — cp1252 console; Unicode arrows silently abort execution. ASCII only in print/log strings.
- **Score thresholds: Python-enforced** — `strong_hire>=85, hire>=70, select>=55, pass<55`. Never rely on Claude's threshold logic.
- **Visibility floor** — score affects rank only, never hides candidates. Un-evaluated candidates sort last (math.inf sentinel).
- **`score_overrides` is append-only** — every override inserts a new row. Never UPDATE or DELETE from it.
- **`hire_evaluations.composite_score` and `.recommendation` are read-only after creation** — override only writes `is_overridden`, `override_recommendation`, `override_rationale`.
- **`dim_averages` uses `is_evaluated` filter, not dict truthiness** — and skips None scores (no zero-default).
- **No sandbox on student iframe** — code-server uses service workers; sandbox blocks them.
- **Guarded mode is honor-system-only (v1)** — enforced via `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` injection; students can delete/edit it. Accepted scope; hard enforcement deferred.
- **Module-level `db_service = DatabaseService()`** in each route file — instantiated at import time.
- **Windows cp1252 print constraint** — see above; applies to ALL print/logging statements.
